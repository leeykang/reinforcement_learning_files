# Gridworld Problem

Uses the Gridworld class for implementing the gridworld problem.

The gridworld problem refers to a task where a 2D grid is provided and a player
can explore the grid. The objective of the task is to obtain as many points as
possible by performing actions on the grid that provide rewards to the player.
These rewards are part of the definition of the grid.

Currently implemented methods for solving the gridworld problem include
value iteration and policy iteration.

Based on Chapter 3 of Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, second edition,
by Sutton and Barto.

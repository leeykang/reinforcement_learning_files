# GridworldV2 Problem

Uses the GridworldV2 class for implementing the gridworld v2 problem.

The gridworld v2 problem refers to a task where a 2D grid is provided and a player
can explore the grid. The objective of the task is to obtain as many points as
possible by performing actions on the grid that provide rewards to the player.
These rewards are part of the definition of the grid.

Currently implemented methods for solving the gridworld v2 problem include
value iteration and policy iteration.

Based on Chapter 4 of Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, second edition,
